# DPMC â€“ Dynamic Pricing Market Controller

**Buy on rails.**  
DPMC releases tokens only when paid demand arrivesâ€”price rises smoothly, rewards fade fairly, and every purchase streams value to the Fund and Global Shareholding.

## What is DPMC?

DPMC = an on-rails token release.  
It sells tokens at a mathematically defined price curve while:

- throttling supply to real paid demand,
- mirroring reward decay over time,
- and streaming a slice of every purchase to:
  - **Fund Treasury (umbrella/DAO)**
  - **Global Shareholding**
  - (optional) **Referrer**

No manual levers, no admin tricksâ€”just rails defined before launch.

## How it works

### 1. Two rails, one ride
- **Price rail (blue curve):** starts low, accelerates upward.  
- **Reward rail (green curve):** starts high, fades as progress grows.  
*Analogy:* like a ski lift and downhillâ€”early riders climb cheap and glide long; late riders climb faster, glide shorter.

### 2. Area pricing (integral)
You pay the *area under the curve*, not a snapshot price.  
*Analogy:* buying water as a river risesâ€”each extra cm costs a bit more.

### 3. Supply throttle
- If DEX < DPMC â†’ buyers go to DEX, DPMC pauses.  
- If DEX > DPMC â†’ buyers use DPMC, supply releases fairly.  
*Analogy:* a pressure valve between tanks.

### 4. Revenue splits
Every purchase auto-streams native to Fund, Shareholding, (optional) Referrer.  
*Analogy:* every ticket cut at the gate is split instantly with the venue and season ticket holders.

### 5. Locked policy, DAO control
Parameters can be locked; ownership behind timelock/DAO.  
*Analogy:* railway signals run by city hall, not backroom switches.
